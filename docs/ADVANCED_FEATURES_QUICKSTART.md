## Tips and Tricks

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Start with Random Forest (faster than SVM)
- Use 5 CV folds for balance between speed and accuracy
- Save the best parameters for later use

### Model Retraining
- Kepler dataset is largest and most reliable
- Neural Networks take longest to train
- Random Forest is fastest and often best performing

### Feature Importance
- Different algorithms may rank features differently
- Focus on the top 5 features for best results
- Use this to understand which data to collect

### Dataset Comparison
- Kepler has most confirmed exoplanets
- TESS focuses on nearby bright stars
- K2 has diverse fields of view

### Educational Content
- Start with Overview for context
- Read Detection Methods to understand the science
- Use Features section as a reference

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No model loaded" error
**Solution**: Train a model first using `python scripts/train_no_normalization.py`

### Hyperparameter tuning takes too long
**Solution**: This is normal. It can take 5-15 minutes. Be patient!

### Model retraining fails
**Solution**: 
- Check that dataset exists in `data/raw/`
- Verify JSON syntax if using custom parameters
- Ensure sufficient disk space

### Dataset comparison shows no data
**Solution**: Download datasets using `python data/dataset_downloader.py`

### Feature importance shows uniform values
**Solution**: This is expected for Neural Networks. Try Random Forest or SVM.
