## ‚ùì Expected Questions & Answers

### "How accurate is your model?"
"90.60% F1 score and 84.94% accuracy on real NASA Kepler data, which is comparable to published research papers in this field."

### "What data did you use?"
"Real NASA Kepler Objects of Interest data - 9,564 observations from the official NASA Exoplanet Archive, processed down to 4,349 high-quality observations."

### "How does it compare to research?"
"Our 90.60% F1 score is in line with published papers like Ansdell et al. (2018) who achieved 85-90% with Random Forest on Kepler data."

### "Can it handle new data?"
"Yes! We have a REST API that can classify single observations in real-time or process batches of up to 1,000 observations via CSV upload."

### "What makes it production-ready?"
"We have model versioning, metadata tracking, comprehensive error handling, input validation, and a full web interface for easy use."

### "Why Random Forest?"
"Random Forest performed best because it handles the non-linear relationships in astronomical data well, captures feature interactions, and is robust to noise."

### "What features does it use?"
"10 astronomical features from NASA data like orbital period, transit duration, depth, planetary radius, and temperature, plus 6 derived features we engineered."

### "How long does training take?"
"About 2-3 minutes on a standard laptop for all three models (Random Forest, Neural Network, SVM)."

### "Can you add more data?"
"Yes! The system is designed to work with TESS and K2 mission data as well. We can easily retrain with additional datasets."

### "What's next?"
"We plan to add hyperparameter tuning, feature importance visualization, and combine data from multiple NASA missions for even better performance."
